    <h3 id="purpose">Why does it matter?</h3>
  <p class="purpose-p"> Artificial intelligence (AI) enables computers and machines to mimic the perception, learning, problem-solving, and decision-making capabilities of the human mind. AI provides many uses in our day-to-day lives, most people would be familiar with digital personal asistants such as Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri or Window's Cortana. </p>
  <p class="purpose-p">However, recent advances now mean AI can be used to drive vehicles, fly rockets, monitoring agricultural conditions or providing recomendations to healthcare profesionals. The more independence these machines posses, in terms of decision making, the greater the chance a decision arises involving risk of human injury. It is therefore curcial to gain an understanding of human decision making, especially what preferences human beings have when faced with moral dilemmas.</p>
  <p class="purpose-p"> The purpose of the Ethics Generator is to collect information via crowd-sourcing to understand human decision making, and what this can mean for ethical decisions made by machine intelligence.</p>
